			<h3>Main Heading</h3>
			<p>In 2009 I started my MBA in Wilfrid Laurier's part time
				program. I don't want to retire, so my goal was to find something
				that I could do into my doderage. I love my MBA so far. Last term I
				took operations and I read "Deep Change" by Michael Hammer. I went
				for beers with my professor Ignacio Castillo after, and we were
				talking about systems as deep change agents. My current thinking is
				that I would like to be an entrepreneurial professor, and I was
				wondering whether "computers as deep change agents" might be a
				systems engineering PHD topic.</p>
			<p>Last term I had a fluke interview with Google, and the
				interviewer asked me what I was most proud of in my career to date.
				I told him that 10 years ago I put on brown shorts and went for a
				ride in a parcel delivery truck. I was helping to do a business
				process analysis on customers paying shippers for merchandise with a
				cheque on delivery. I was working for a cheque sorter company to
				provide a solution to a bank to deposit these cheques directly into
				the shipper's bank accounts with that bank. The bank was working for
				a parcel delivery company to outsource the flow of cheques back to
				shippers by depositing them directly into their accounts. This past
				term I was accepted into Laurier's Entrepreneurship Accelerator
				Program based on this transportation concept.</p>
			<h3>Transportation Post Peak</h3>
			<p>According to Christopher Alexander in his 1977 work, A Pattern
				Language, A city contains a great number of places, distributed
				rather evenly across a two-dimensional sheet. The trips people want
				to make are typically between two points at random in this sheet. No
				one linear system (like a train system), can give direct connections
				between the vast possible number of point pairs in the city. This is
				the pervasive problem that I think people will pay me to have
				solved.</p>
			<p>Many people are already paying at least $4,080 a year for a
				24-mile round-trip commute by owning a second car. By adding the
				time spent commuting of 40 minutes a day or 166 hours/year at
				$25/hour the total cost becomes $8230 a year. My idea is to reduce
				the total cost by sharing the transportation supply among multiple
				users and giving these commuters a chance to use the time
				productively by exercising. Energy harvested from exercise could
				even help power the transportation, further reducing the operating
				costs!</p>
			<p>With cellular and gps technology more point to point
				transportation can be achieved in a way that it couldn't when
				Alexander wrote his book, during the OPEC shortages of the late 70s.
				When transportation supply is matched to transportation demand using
				clustering techniques, a more cost effective system is realized with
				similar convenience. The system is seeded with initial clusters of
				transportation demand by writing a google maps web mash-up that
				tells you when you should leave according to predicted and current
				conditions. In the process of predicting leaving times this mash-up
				will harvest the travel points and desired arrival time. After the
				mashup has made its contribution to initial system design it can be
				used to advertise the existence of the system with buy now
				functionality. Trips are booked on the (mobile) web, giving
				progressive discounts and shorter travel times as more people
				participate.</p>
