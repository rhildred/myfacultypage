      <h3>Curriculum Change</h3>

      <p>Christmas break 2009, after the first term of my MBA, I was deeply dissapointed that the integrated core curriculum seemed focused on business as usual <a href=

    <h3>Main Heading</h3>
<p>
In 2009 I started my MBA in Wilfrid Laurier's part time program. I don't want to retire, so my goal was to find something that I could do into my doderadge. I love my MBA so far. Last term I took operations and I read "Deep Change" by Michael Hammer. I went for beers with my professor Ignacio Castillo after, and we were talking about systems as deep change agents. My current thinking is that I would like to be an entrepreneurial professor, and I was wondering whether "computers as deep change agents" might be a systems engineering PHD topic. 
</p><p>
Last term I had a fluke interview with Google, and the interviewer asked me what I was most proud of in my career to date. I told him that 10 years ago I put on brown shorts and went for a ride in a parcel delivery truck. I was helping to do a business process analysis on customers paying shippers for merchandise with a cheque on delivery. I was working for a cheque sorter company to provide a solution to a bank to deposit these cheques directly into the shipper's bank accounts with that bank. The bank was working for a parcel delivery company to outsource the flow of cheques back to shippers by depositing them directly into their accounts. This past term I was accepted into Laurier's Entrepreneurship Accelerator Program based on this transportation concept.
</p>
      <h3>Transportation Post Peak</h3>
<p>According to Christopher Alexander in his 1977 work, A Pattern Language, A city contains a great
number of places, distributed rather evenly across a two-dimensional sheet. The trips people want to
make are typically between two points at random in this sheet. No one linear system (like a train
system), can give direct connections between the vast possible number of point pairs in the city. This
is the pervasive problem that I think people will pay me to have solved.
</p>
<p>Many people are already paying at least $4,080 a year for a 24-mile round-trip commute by owning a
second car. By adding the time spent commuting of 40 minutes a day or 166 hours/year at $25/hour the
total cost becomes $8230 a year. My idea is to reduce the total cost by sharing the transportation supply
among multiple users and giving these commuters a chance to use the time productively by exercising.
Energy harvested from exercise could even help power the transportation, further reducing the
operating costs!
</p>
<p>With cellular and gps technology more point to point transportation can be achieved in a way that it
couldnt when Alexander wrote his book, during the OPEC shortages of the late 70s. When
transportation supply is matched to transportation demand using clustering techniques, a more cost
effective system is realized with similar convenience. The system is seeded with initial clusters of
transportation demand by writing a google maps web mash-up that tells you when you should leave
according to predicted and current conditions. In the process of predicting leaving times this mash-up
will harvest the travel points and desired arrival time. After the mashup has made its contribution to
initial system design it can be used to advertise the existence of the system with buy now
functionality. Trips are booked on the (mobile) web, giving progressive discounts and shorter travel
times as more people participate.
